      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/headshot.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="placeholder">

      <p>I am currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp through the University of Kansas with plans to graduate in December 2017. I also graduated with my undergrad degree from the University of Kansas in May of 2009 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Education with an emphasis in Sport and Fitness Management as well as a minor in Business. I am currently employed full-time by the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America in Lawrence, KS as an Ad Traffic and Account Coordinator.</p>

      <p>As Ad Traffic & Account Coordinator for GCSAA, I am responsible for a variety of roles within the Corporate Sales department, an $8 million property. I manage a handful of clients and promote the message of GCSAA through partnership with their brands. I work internally as a liaison between our sales and publications teams. I am also responsible for managing the relationship with our print rep, the production of our magazine and all of the special advertising opportunities with each monthly issue. Digitally, I am responsible for implementing and tracking impressions for our partners online ads and was instrumental in creating personalized dashboards and reports in both Google Analytics and DoubleClick to determine the ROI for our advertising partners.</p>
